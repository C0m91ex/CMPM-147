				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color: The sky, sand, hut, dunes in the background and the suns colors were sampled from the inspiring image using color picker tools from the web.</li>
                        <li>Primitives: The little hut and both the suns were created using primiitive shapes. </li>
                        <li>Polygons: The background mountain is a single randomly polygon using vertex calls.</li>
                        <li>Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped dunes.</li>
                        <li>Life: Both of the suns in the background bring to life the sense that this is a landscape that is on some other planet.</li>
                    </ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> I really enjoyed doing this assignment, I loved loosely recreating an image from one of my favorite universes and creating it in a simplistic art style is perfect. The hardest part would probably building out the shape of the hut and getting the numbers for the positions correct.</p>
